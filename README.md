# Assignment_1
This is a project for the first week at Noroff

Our assignment was simple, yet challenging. Create classes to an RPG game!

The game we were following was something equal to Diablo 2/3 were we had the base classes warrior, mage, ranger and rogue. These classes were supposed to have a way of leveling up, equipping armor and equipping weapons. After the logic was implemented we had to make some tests for it.
